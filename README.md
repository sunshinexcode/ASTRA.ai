### Voice agent: Astra

[Voice agent: Astra](https://theastra.ai)

Astra is a voice agent, powered by TEN, demonstrating its ability to create intuitive and seamless conversational interactions.

[![Showcase Astra](https://github.com/rte-design/docs/blob/main/assets/gifs/astra-voice-agent.gif?raw=true)](https://theastra.ai)\


### How to build voice agent locally

#### Prerequisites

**Keys**

* Agora App ID and App Certificate([read here on how](https://docs.agora.io/en/video-calling/get-started/manage-agora-account?platform=web))
* Azure's [speech-to-text](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text) and [text-to-speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/text-to-speech) API keys
* [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) API key

**Installation**

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) / [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* [Node.js(LTS) v18](https://nodejs.org/en)

**Minimum system requirements**

* CPU >= 2 Core
* RAM >= 4 GB

**Docker setting on Apple Silicon**

You will need to uncheck "Use Rosetta for x86\_64/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon" option for Docker if you are on Apple Silicon, otherwise the server is not going to work.

![Docker Setting](https://github.com/rte-design/docs/blob/main/assets/gifs/docker-setting.gif?raw=true)

#### Next step

**1. Prepare config files**

In the root of the project, create these files from the examples. They will be used to store information for Docker Compose later.

```bash
# Create .env from the example
cp ./.env.example ./.env

# Create property.json from the example
cp ./agents/property.json.example ./agents/property.json
```

**2. Setup API keys & Environment variables in .env file**

Open the `.env` file and fill in the keys and regions. This is also where you can choose to use any different extensions:

```
# Agora App ID and Agora App Certificate
# required: this variable must be set
AGORA_APP_ID=
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=

# Extension: agora_rtc
# Azure STT key and region
AZURE_STT_KEY=
AZURE_STT_REGION=

# Extension: azure_tts
# Azure TTS key and region
AZURE_TTS_KEY=
AZURE_TTS_REGION=

# Extension: openai_chatgpt
# OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

**3. Start agent builder toolkit containers**

In the same directory, run the `docker` command to compose containers:

```bash
# Execute docker compose up to start the services
docker compose up
```

**4. Build your agent and start server**

Open up a separate terminal window, build the agent and start the server:

```bash
# Enter container to build agent
docker exec -it astra_agents_dev bash
make build

# Run server on port 8080
make run-server
```

**5. Use graph designer to customize voice agent**

You can open https://localhost:3001 in browser to use your graph designer. Simultaneously, open another tab at https://localhost:3000 to see the customized voice agent up and running.

Now you have the power of the Graph Designer at your fingertips to perform the magic of agent customization yourself. ðŸŽ‰

**Graph designer**

TEN Graph Designer (beta), a tool that requires zero coding knowledge and makes the experience of creating agentic applications smoother.

### TEN Service

Now that youâ€™ve created your first AI agent, the creativity doesn't stop here. To develop more amazing agents, youâ€™ll need an advanced understanding of how the TEN works under the hood. Please refer to the [TEN service documentation ](docs/astra-architecture.md).
